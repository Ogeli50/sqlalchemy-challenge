# sqlalchemy-challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.
Part 1 is to Analyze and Explore the Climate Data using Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, youâ€™ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis and finally, design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes.
